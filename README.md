# titanic-data_analysis
Hello Everyone before begining this project I would like to recommend you to read this description thoroughly for a proper understanding of my project.

Let's Begin

The dataset(train.csv) used in this project can be downloaded through one of the most popular website for Datasets that's Kaggle or you can refer my repository too.For understanding this project you need to have an intermediate level of knowledge on Python and its libraries namely Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborne and also some basic knowledge of Statistics.

Data Dictionary:

| Variable | Definition                                |Key                                            |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| survival |Survival	                                 |0 = No, 1 = Yes                                |
| pclass	 |Ticket class	                             |1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd                      |
| sex	     |Sex	                                       |                                               |
| Age	     |Age in years	                             |                                               |
| sibsp	   |# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic |	                                             |
| parch	   |# of parents / children aboard the Titanic |                                               |
| ticket	 |Ticket number	                             |                                               |
| fare	   |Passenger fare	                           |                                               |
| cabin	   |Cabin number	                             |                                               |
| embarked |Port of Embarkation	                       |C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton |

Variable Notes:

pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister

Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...

Parent = mother, father

Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson

Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

Now, I would be answering the following questions given below through Data Analysis and Visualization in Python:

1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)

2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?

3.) Where did the passengers come from?

4.) Who was alone and who was with family?

5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

6.) Did the deck have an effect on the passengers survival rate? Did this answer match up with your intuition?

7.) Did having a family member increase the odds of surviving the crash?
